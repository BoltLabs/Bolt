# Bolt

Bolt is the cryptocurrency for producers. Rather than the traditional debt-based model of financing product, Bolt uses a grant-based system. Miners earn Bolt by helping Producers while Producers in turn sell their products for Bolt. Join the future economy by signing up [here](http://join.bolt.bz).

### What is Nano?

---

Nano's goal is to become _"a global currency with instantaneous transactions and zero fees over a secure, decentralized network."_

We've applied the philosophy of _"do one thing and do it well"_, we are focused on building the best medium for value exchange in the world.

---

### Key Features

* Nano utilizes a novel [block-lattice](https://github.com/nanocurrency/raiblocks/wiki/Block-lattice) architecture, unlike conventional blockchains used in many other cryptocurrencies.
* The network requires minimal resources, no high-power mining hardware, and can process high transaction throughput.
* Offers instantaneous transactions with zero fees and unlimited scalability, making Nano an ideal solution for peer-to-peer transactions.
* As of May 2018, the Nano network has processed over ten million transactions with an unpruned ledger size of only 3.8GB.

### Key Technological Features

* Bolt's core technology is forked from [Nano](https://github.com/nanocurrency/raiblocks) utilizing the [block-lattice](https://github.com/nanocurrency/raiblocks/wiki/Block-lattice) architecture, allowing instant feeless transactions with unlimited scalability.
* Bolt will implement the Diamond Lattice, derived from [RingCT 2.0](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-66399-9_25), for default on privacy with view keys for account auditing.
* Masternode staking is added in the Diamond Lattice to the block-lattice to resolve both the long term network stability issue and the problem of unknown amounts of currency held in private nodes. Masternodes publish their viewkeys, allowing the network to verify their ability to vote on forks.
