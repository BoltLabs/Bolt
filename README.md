### Bolt


Bolt is the future of global transactions. It is accomplishing this by developing technology that promises instant, feeless, and private transactions. Combining the latest in cryptocurrency technological developments with real world use cases creates a clear path towards reaching the goal of a world where transactions are seamless and protected from malicious actors.

### Key Features

* Bolt's core technology is forked from [Nano](https://github.com/nanocurrency/raiblocks) utilizing the [block-lattice](https://github.com/nanocurrency/raiblocks/wiki/Block-lattice) architecture, allowing instant feeless transactions with unlimited scalability.
* Bolt will implement the Diamond Lattice, derived from [RingCT 2.0](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-66399-9_25), for default on privacy with view keys for account auditing.
* Masternode staking is added to the block-lattice to resolve both the long term network stability issue and the problem of unknown amounts of currency held in private nodes. Masternodes publish their viewkeys, allowing the network to verify their ability to vote on forks.
